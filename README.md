## objective
as a developer, i wanted to create a README generator so that i can quickly create a professional README for any new project

## usage
- a command-line application that accepts user input will prompt user for information about their application repository
- a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of user's project and sections
- all information entered is added to the corresponding sections of the README
- when a user chooses a license for the application from a list of options, a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is linked to the section of the README that explains which license the application is covered under
- when a user adds their email and github username, it is added to the questions portion of the README
- when the user clicks on the links in the table of contents, they are taken to the corresponding section of the README
